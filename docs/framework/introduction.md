# Introduction
Welcome to Microservices Reference Framework! This framework serves to introduce, educate and provide guide through the architectural style of `microservices`.

Reason for creating this framework was lacking participation of [] and bootcamps in software architecture education. More information on this topic can be found in my thesis. Goal of this framework is to provide a collection of artifacts to aid in education in software architecture domain. Specifically, targeting the popular architectural style of microservices.
