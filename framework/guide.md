- **Microservice description** - This chapter contains a high-level description, overview and reference model of microservices architecture.
- **Architecture characteristics** - Because charateristics of architectural styles are one of the most important aspects for software architecture, I have decided to dedicate a chapter to characteristics of microservices.
- **Business cases for microservices** - This artifact revolves around discussion around practical real world applications of microservices. This can be used to showcase the advanteges, disadvantages and a realty of actually applying this architectural style.
- **On-hands project** - Having a discussion around real world applications of microservices is extremely valuable, but it is also important to have a more hand-on experience with implementation of an architecture. For this reason I have prepared a sample project/solution to demonstrate microservices with the option to explore its implementation throught its source code or <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>.
- **Summary** - This section is the conclusion of this framework. So, here you can find the summary of microservices. This includes the following:
    - _Mapping of microservice characteristics_ - 
    - Advanced topics - It was important for me to include a list of more advanced topics related to microservice as a waypoint for diving deeper into microservices.
- **Used literature and sources** - This chapter can server as a list of recommended literature for further studies in this architectural style.
